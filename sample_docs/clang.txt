The C Language is developed for creating system applications that direct interacts to the hardware devices such as drivers, kernals etc.

C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.

It can be defined by following ways:

Mother language
System programming language
Structured programming language
Mid level programming language
C features:
C is the widely used language. It provides a lot of features that are given below.

Simple
Mid-level programming language
procedure oriented language but not object oriented
structured programming language
Rich Library
Memory Management
Robust
Pointers
Recursion
Extensible
Compiler based
platform dependent

C uses concept of structures (not object oriented).
In C we use the concept of pointers whereas there are no pointers used in JAVA
In C the programmer needs to manage memory manually. “malloc()” and “free()” are the fundamental memory allocation library calls.
In C the declaration of variables should be on the beginning of the block.
C supports go to statement, struct and union unlike Java
C is compiled to the machines “native language” so it’s execution is much faster than Java’s.
No reuse in code and by default members are public.
C programs will have a larger memory footprint than an equivalent program written in pure machine code, but the total memory use of a C program is much smaller than the a Java program because C does not require the loading of an execution interpreter like the JVM.
The main differences between Java and C are speed, portability, and object-orientation.
